# temperature-monitor

## Features
- Monitor should be able to read temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensor.
- Monitor should log temperature and humidity readings.
- Monitor should only log temperature and humidity readings when there is a delta.

## Roadmap
- Monitor should be able to record the protocol data for a real device over a
specific time period.
- Monitor should be able to calculate/adjust protocol timing variables at runtime.
- Monitor should ship log "events" to cloud storage for processing/visualization.
